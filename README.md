# F_POI
### Paper validation demo

## Scope
This repository currently provides a simplified demo for paper validation. It includes four test groups and a minimal runnable flow; additional modules and full experiments will be added later.

## Test Groups
The demo supports four group sizes. To switch between groups, update both values consistently in `FPOI.py`:

```python
classN = 2  # 2 / 4 / 8 / 16
range(2)    # 2 / 4 / 8 / 16
```
